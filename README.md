# ci-bootstrap

Re-useable, version controlled, collection of scripts to setup a CI server quickly and easily. 

Each of the scripts in this repo can be executed by: 

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/levibostian/ci-bootstrap/path/to/file.sh
```

*Note: It's up to you to use a version-controlled commit hash for the path to the script, or, use a branch such as `master` that is always up-to-date.*
